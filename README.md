- Always check **permissions** before installing any extension.  
- Extensions can secretly track user behavior or modify web content.  
- Removing unnecessary extensions improves **speed and privacy**.  
- Official sources (like the **Chrome Web Store**) are safer than third-party sites.

## 🧠 How Malicious Extensions Harm Users
Malicious extensions can:
- Steal saved passwords or cookies.
- Track browsing history and online activities.
- Redirect users to phishing or malicious websites.
- Display intrusive ads or crypto-mining scripts.
- Exfiltrate sensitive data via background scripts.

---

## 🔐 Best Practices for Safe Browsing
- Install only from **trusted sources**.
- Review permissions **before installing**.
- Keep extensions **updated** regularly.
- Remove any **unused or suspicious** add-ons.
- Report malicious extensions via the **Chrome Web Store’s “Report Abuse”** feature.
